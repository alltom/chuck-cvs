18.ck		vm:outofbounds		array out of bounds
19.ck		type:exceeds dimension at 4	array passed to function

p01.ck		emitted			assignment from multi-array to a value
p02.ck		emitted			array to array sub-assignment ( like 17.ck )
p03.ck		parse at 9:9		function definition outside class decl
p04.ck		emit,bus error		assignment to class members
p05.ck		Obj undefined) at 6     member function taking class instance as argument
p06.ck				
p07.ck		emitted			array of a particular class
p08.ck		undefined type at 7	class with self as member
p09.ck		emitted			class with declared, defined class as member
p10.ck		undefined type at 6	class with udeclared, undefined class as member
p11.ck		parse at 3:16		class with declared, undefined class as member
p12.ck		type fails(correct)	type mismatch in object assignment
p13.ck		emitted			cast subclass to parent class
p14.ck		type fails(correct)	assign parent class to subclass
p15.ck		emitted			cast subclass array to parent array
p16.ck		emitted ( should fail type check ) cast parent class array to subclass array
p17.ck		emitted		        array assignment - length mismatch ( large to small )

p25.ck		emit error at 5		test pass by value
p26.ck					array pass by reference
