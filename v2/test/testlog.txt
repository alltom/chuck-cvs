01.ck		emitted			assignment (int)
02.ck		emitted			assignment (float)
03.ck		emitted			arithmetic ( addition )
04.ck		emitted, loops		infinite loop ( while true )
05.ck		emitted			time
06.ck		emitted			durations
07.ck		emitted			division
08.ck		emitted			variable lookup
09.ck		emitted			+=>
10.ck		emitted			void function
11.ck		emitted			function returning float
12.ck		emitted			class def and instantiate
13.ck		emitted			class inheritance
14.ck		emitted			array instantiation
15.ck		emitted			multi-dim array instantiation
16.ck		emitted			multi-array assignment
17.ck		emitted			partial array
18.ck		emitted			array out of bounds
19.ck		emitted			array passed to function

p01.ck		emitted			assignment from multi-array to a value
p02.ck		emitted			array to array sub-assignment ( like 17.ck )
p03.ck		parse at 9:9		function definition outside class decl
p04.ck		emit,bus error		assignment to class members
p05.ck		undefined type error 6  member function taking class instance as argument
p06.ck				
p07.ck		emitted			array of a particular class
p08.ck		undefined type at 7	class with self as member
p09.ck		emitted			class with declared, defined class as member
p10.ck		undefined type at 6	class with udeclared, undefined class as member
p11.ck		parse at 3:16		class with declared, undefined class as member
p12.ck		type fails(correct)	type mismatch in object assignment
p13.ck		emitted			cast subclass to parent class
p14.ck		type fails(correct)	assign parent class to subclass
p15.ck		emitted			cast subclass array to parent array
p16.ck		emitted ( should fail type check ) cast parent class array to subclass array
p17.ck		emitted		        array assignment - length mismatch ( large to small ) 
p18.ck		emitted			array assignment - length mismatch ( small to large )
p19.ck		fail type ( correct )   array => array ( should fail ) 
p20.ck		emitted			for loop with -=>, *=>
p21.ck		emit, incorrect return	functional of p20 modify argument in function
p22.ck		emit, incorrect return	functional of p20 modify local variable..
p23.ck		emit			function taking argument
p24.ck		emit, correct		function taking two arguments
p25.ck		emit, correct		test pass by value
p26.ck		emit error exceeds dimension ( see 19.ck ) array pass by reference
p27.ck		emitted, correct	function calling second function
p28.ck					recursive function
p29.ck					variable access outside defining block

--Notes--

mar 29, 7:55pm p21 - 25 all give an error from defining a function taking an argument.
mar 29, 2:56am : changed p02.ck to a @=> instead of =>  : success!
