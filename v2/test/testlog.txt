--Notes--

apr 3	       p30,31,32,37 fixed
apr 3 -        p16 - typing needs to be check for array comparisons. 
mar 31: 3pm    p16 bug still up - ( assigning parent array to subclass array )
mar 31, 9:50am windows : p37, p30
mar 31, 9:00am float comparisions proper on Windows, error on OSX ( FIXED NOW );
mar 30, 9:00   float comparisons appear to be broken ( p52.ck ) 
mar 30, 4:00   p30,31,32,37 - calling member functions causes a bus error.
mar 30, 3:00   p34 - global modified inside function doesn't persist outside function.
mar 30, 3:00   functions take arguments, but functions returning variable don't work
mar 29, 7:55pm FIXED : p21 - 25 all give an error from defining a function taking an argument.
mar 29, 2:56am : changed p02.ck to a @=> instead of =>  : success!
