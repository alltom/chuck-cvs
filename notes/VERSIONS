1.2.0.0

  SYNTAX and OPERATORS:
  - (added) +=>, operator : 2 +=> i; (also) -=>, *=>, /=>, %=>
  - (added) @=> for explicit assignment
    this is the only way to make object reference assignments
  - (added) implicit int to float casting
  - (changed) cast now look like: 1.1 $ (int) => int i;
  - (added) function call by chucking : 
    // call
    (1,4) => math.rand2f => result;
    // same as
    math.rand2f(1,4) => result;

  LANGUAGE:
  - (fixed) type system for existing types

  OBJECTS:
  - (added) 'class' definitions : class X { int i; }
  - (added) 'exterds' keyword : class Y extends event { int i; }
  - (added) virtual inheritance
  - (added) added pre-constructors - code at class level
    gets run when object is instantiated
  - (added) function overloading :
    class X { fun void foo() { }  fun void foo( int y ) { } }
  - (added) base classes (can be extended):
    Object, event, array, ugen, string
    see below.

  EVENTS:
  - (added) base event class : event e;
    can be used directly
    can be extended to custom events
    (see one_event_many_shreds.ck)
  - (added) waiting on event, chuck to now : 
    e => now; // wait on e
  - (added) e.signal() wakes up 1 shred, if any
  - (added) e.broadcast() wakes up all shreds waiting on e
  - (added) class MidiEvent (see gomidi2.ck)
    alternative to polling.
  - (added) class OSCEvent

  ARRAYS:
  - (added) arrays : int a[10]; float b[20]; event e[2];
  - (added) multidimensional arrays : int a[2][2][2];
  - (added) associative arrays : int a[10]; 0 => a["foo"];
    all arrays are both int-indexed and associative
  - (added) array initialization : [ 1, 2, 3 ] @=> int a[];
  - (added) .cap() for array capacity
  - (added) .find() test if item is associative array
  - (added) .erase() erase item in associative array

  UGENS:
  - (added) class ugen
    can be extended
  - (changed) all ugen parameters are now also functions:
    // set freq
    440 => s.freq => val;
    // same as...
    s.freq( 440 ) => val;
  - (changed) left-most parameters must now be called as functions
    // no longer valid
    f.freq => float val;
    // valid
    f.freq() => float val;
    // still ok
    440 => s.freq => float val;

  STRINGS:
  - (added) class string

  AUDIO:
  - (added) stereo
    all stereo unit generators have .left, .right, .pan functions
  - (changed) stereo ugen: dac (2 in, 2 out)
  - (changed) stereo ugen: adc (0 in, 2 out)
  - (added) stereo ugen: pan2 (1 in, 2 out)
  - (added) stereo ugen: mix2 (2 in, 1 out)

1.1.5.6 - 2005.4.11
  - last 1.1 release : contains all 1.1 changes


---
1.1.5.5 - 2005.2.10
  - FIFO to RR for audio and synthesis - improves stability on OS X
  - fixed stack underflow emitter bug with declarations
  - fixed cpu sleep bug on win32


---
1.1.5.4 - 2004.11.18
  - fixed clicks when using adc unit generator
    (thanks to paul botelho for testing)
  - added 'maybe' keyword
    maybe == 0 or 1, with 50% probability each

new examples:
  - maybe.ck : the maybe keyword - bad idea? maybe.
  - maybecli.ck : maybe click, maybe not

adc examples work better:
  - adc.ck
  - echo.ck
  - i-robot.ck


---
1.1.5.3 - 2004.11.4
  - when a shred is removed from VM, all children shreds are 
    also recursively removed
    (this fix crash due to removing shreds with active children shreds)
    (to keep children around, put parent in infinite time-loop)
    (this isn't always good - real solution coming soon)
  - 'start' keyword now available - holds the a shred's begin time

updated examples:
  - powerup.ck : start local variable changed name
  - spork.ck : added infinite time loop to keep children active


---
1.1.5.2 - 2004.10.17

  - same as 1.1.5.1 - see below


---
1.1.5.1 - 2004.10.15
  - on-the-fly chuck files to remote hosts!
    > chuck @hostname + foo.ck
    > chuck @hostname -p<N> + foo.ck
  - TCP replacing UDP for commands
  - endian observed (mac <-> win32/linux)
  - more sensible VM output for on-the-fly commands
  - many on-the-fly bug fixes
  - --replace: new shred inherits the replaced shred id
    (useful to keep track of shreds in VM)
  - sndbuf automatically set .rate to 1.0 (instead of 0.0)
    (0.0 => buf.rate if no play on next time advance)
  - new on-the-fly examples

new examples:

  - otf_*.ck - illustrates precise on-the-fly timing
    (adapted from Perry's ChucK drumming + Ge's sine poops)

    chuck them one by one into the VM:

      terminal 1%> chuck --loop
      terminal 2%> chuck + otf_01.ck
      (wait)
      terminal 2%> chuck + otf_02.ck
      (wait)
      (repeat through otf_07.ck)
      (remove, replace and add your own)


---

  - now able to write audio files (wav, aiff, raw)
    (try rec.ck and rec2.ck concurrently with any other shreds
     to record to disk)

    on little endian systems)
