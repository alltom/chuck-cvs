\section{Stereo}

At long last, ChucK is stereo! Accessing the stereo capabilities of ChucK are relatively simple. {\bf dac} now has three access points. 

\begin{verbatim}
    ugen u;
    // standard mono connection
    u => dac;

    // simple enough!
    u => dac.left;
    u => dac.right;
\end{verbatim}
